## Problems and Suggested Improvements
***Mechanical***: The cutter motor sometimes fail to cut through the wire due to under current. In future, try replace timming belt with lead screw for higher percision and torque.

***Software***: In future, add emergency stop for safety. Also add EEPROM methods to save values such as steps-per-mm and preset wire lengths.
