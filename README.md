# Arduino Automatic Wire Cutter

## Description

This machine cuts solid-strand wire into specified length to be used on breadboards.

## Problems and Suggested Improvements

### Mechanical
The cutter motor sometimes fail to cut through the wire due to under current.
In future, try replace timming belt with lead screw for higher percision and torque.

### Software
In future, add emergency stop for safety.
In future, add EEPROM functions to save values such as steps-per-mm and preset wire lengths.
